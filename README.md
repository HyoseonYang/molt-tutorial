This notebook is intended to serve as a tool to demonstrate the coding process for the Method-of-Lines-Transpose (MOLT). Here we solve a class of nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations with non-smooth solutions. The proposed method relies on a special kernel based formulation of the solutions found in our early work on the method of lines transpose and successive convolution. Additionally, our document is designed to be entirely self-contained with detailed explanations, supplemented with relevant snippets from publications.
